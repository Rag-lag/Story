And so we start our journey from no where. And i actually mean a place called nowhere. It is complicated but we have to start 
somwhere dont we. Anyways the story is about a person who wanted to acheive something more in life. No destiny told him to acheive it it was just is desire to do so.
Don't we all want to acheive something more in our lives. so as we move on in the story you will find that maybe this person is somebody you know, but mind you, you are wrong
it is not someone you know it is you yourself and i am sorry to tell you that you know freighteningly little about yourself. Well id ont knw how to make this an alien story so here we go never the less i guess i will try my best and we do mess we just revert back to rest.
